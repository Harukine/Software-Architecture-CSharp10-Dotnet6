# 3 Documenting Requirements with Azure DevOps
- Azure DevOps, an evolution of Visual Studio Team Services, is a comprehensive tool provided by Microsoft that offers new features to help developers document and organize their software. This chapter provides an overview of Azure DevOps, covering topics such as creating an Azure DevOps project, understanding its functionalities, and organizing and managing requirements within the tool. The chapter also presents use cases in Azure DevOps. The first two sections give a general summary of Azure DevOps functionalities, while the subsequent sections focus on documenting requirements and supporting the development process.
## Introducing Azure DevOps
- Azure DevOps is a Microsoft Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that allows you to deliver continuous value to your customers. By creating an account, you can efficiently plan your projects, securely store your code, conduct testing, deploy solutions to staging environments, and finally, publish them to production infrastructure. It provides a comprehensive set of tools to support the entire software development lifecycle.

## Organizing your work using Azure DevOps
- Azure DevOps as a philosophy centered around delivering value to customers. It combines people, processes, and products, leveraging the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) methodology to continuously improve software applications throughout their development and production lifecycle. Azure DevOps serves as a versatile tool that encompasses all stages, from initial development to the CI/CD process. Azure DevOps contains tools for collecting requirements and for organizing the whole development
process.

### Azure DevOps Repository
- The Repos menu item gives you access to a default Git repository where you can place your projectâ€™s

### Package feeds
- The Artifacts menu in Azure DevOps manages software packages utilized or generated by the project. It allows for the creation of feeds to accommodate various types of packages such as NuGet, Node.js, and Python. Private feeds are necessary for commercial projects that utilize private packages, providing a designated location for them. Additionally, packages generated during builds are stored in these feeds, enabling other modules dependent on them to access and utilize them promptly.

### Test plans
- The Test Plans section in Azure DevOps provides the ability to define and manage test plans, including their settings. This feature allows for the execution and tracking of different types of tests, such as manual acceptance tests, automatic unit tests, and load tests. Automatic unit tests are created within test projects in Visual Studio and utilize frameworks like NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest. Test Plans allows for the configuration of test settings, scheduling of test execution, and tracking of test results within the project documentation. Manual tests can also be defined, providing instructions for the test operator and specifying the environment and reporting requirements. Load tests can be executed with defined parameters and their results can be measured.

### Pipelines
- Pipelines in Azure DevOps are automated action plans that encompass all steps from code building to software deployment in production. In the Pipelines section, you can define a comprehensive pipeline consisting of tasks and triggering events, including code building, test plan execution, and post-test actions. Typically, after passing tests, the application is automatically deployed to a staging environment for beta testing. Criteria for automatic deployment to production can be established, such as the duration of beta testing, the number of bugs found and resolved, and manual approval from managers or team members. As a software architect, it's important to prioritize safety when moving code to production.

## Managing system requirements in Azure DevOps
- In Azure DevOps, system requirements can be managed through work items, which are units of information assigned to individuals. Work items are categorized into different types and include details such as development effort, status, and the iteration they belong to. Azure DevOps follows agile methodologies and organizes the development process into sprints or iterations. The available work item types depend on the selected work item process, such as Agile or Scrum.

### Epic work items
- Epic work items are used to encapsulate multiple subsystems or features that span across several development iterations. Epics serve as an umbrella for these features and provide a high-level view of the project. Within an Epic work item, you can define its state, acceptance criteria, start date, target date, priority, and effort estimate. This detailed information helps stakeholders to track and understand the development process at a macro level.

### Feature work items
- Feature work items in Azure DevOps serve as a place to document user requirements and define the functionality needed for a specific feature or aspect of the system. While Epic work items encapsulate multiple subsystems and span across multiple iterations, Feature work items are typically implemented within a few sprints and are part of a single Epic work item. The difference between Epics and Features lies in their roles and the goals they aim to achieve. Both work item types can contain the same information, such as state, acceptance criteria, start date, target date, priority, and effort estimate. Additionally, all work items have sections for team discussions and the ability to link and attach various information.

### Product Backlog/User Story work items
- Product Backlog items and User Story work items in Azure DevOps serve the same purpose of capturing detailed requirements for features. The availability of these work items depends on the selected work item process. They are connected to parent Feature work items and specify the requirements for individual functionalities within those features. For example, in a Feature work item for system access control, the maintenance of users and the login interface could be two separate User Stories/Product Backlog items.
- In addition to Product Backlog items/User Story work items, there are two other types of work items commonly associated with them:

1. Tasks: These work items describe the specific job that needs to be done to fulfill the requirements stated in the parent Product Backlog/User Story work item. Tasks can include time estimates to help with capacity management and scheduling for the team.

2. Test cases: These items outline how to test the functionality described by the requirements. The number of tasks and test cases created for each Product Backlog/User Story work item may vary depending on the development and testing scenario being used.

## Summary
- In this chapter, the process of creating an Azure DevOps account for a software development project was discussed, along with an overview of its functionalities. The chapter provided detailed guidance on managing system requirements and organizing work using different types of work items. It also covered the planning and organization of sprints to deliver comprehensive solutions with multiple features. Overall, the chapter served as a comprehensive guide to getting started with Azure DevOps and effectively managing software development projects.
