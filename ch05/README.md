# 5 Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application
- This chapter focuses on highly scalable architectures using microservices, which are small modules that enable fine-grained scaling and independent evolution. The chapter covers the concept of microservices, their benefits, how .NET handles them, and the necessary tools for managing microservices. By the end of the chapter, you will have gained knowledge on implementing a microservice in .NET.

## What are microservices?
- Microservice architectures provide independent scalability of modules, reducing resource waste and overall cost. They enable the development, maintenance, and deployment of software modules independently. This improves the CI/CD cycle by allowing scaling on different hardware, eliminating compatibility constraints, simplifying job organization, utilizing appropriate technologies, matching developers' competencies, and integrating legacy subsystems with newer ones. The section also discusses the origins of microservices and their design principles, including the use of Docker containers.

### Microservices and the evolution of the concept of modules
- Microservices represent an evolution in the concept of deployment modularity, building upon the foundations of code modularity. They emerged as a response to the limitations of DLL-based modularity and the challenges of version compatibility. The progression from monolithic executables to static libraries, dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and then to platforms like .NET and Java facilitated deployment on different hardware and operating systems. However, the inability to handle different versions of shared dependencies led to the adoption of package management systems and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), where deployment units were implemented as web services. Microservices, as an evolution of SOA, enhance scalability and modularity, improving the CI/CD cycle. They are considered a refined implementation of SOA with additional features and constraints.
