# Deciding on the Best Cloud-Based Solution
- This chapter focuses on designing cloud-based applications and understanding various software architecture models. It explores the opportunities provided by the cloud and discusses different types of cloud services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Serverless solutions. The chapter also covers the use of hybrid solutions and their benefits. The choice between these options depends on the specific project scenario, which will be further discussed in the chapter.

## Different software deployment models
- Cloud solutions can be deployed using different models depending on the type of team and organization. Companies with infrastructure engineers typically opt for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where they have more control over the infrastructure. On the other hand, companies whose core business is not IT often prefer Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. Developers may choose Platform as a Service (PaaS) or serverless options when they don't need to manage the infrastructure. As a software architect, it is important to optimize cost and work factors throughout the development and maintenance of the solution. It is crucial to understand the system's needs and connect them with peripheral solutions to accelerate delivery and meet customer specifications.
