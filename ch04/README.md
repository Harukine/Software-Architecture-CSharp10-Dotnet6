# Deciding on the Best Cloud-Based Solution
- This chapter focuses on designing cloud-based applications and understanding various software architecture models. It explores the opportunities provided by the cloud and discusses different types of cloud services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Serverless solutions. The chapter also covers the use of hybrid solutions and their benefits. The choice between these options depends on the specific project scenario, which will be further discussed in the chapter.
