# Deciding on the Best Cloud-Based Solution
- This chapter focuses on designing cloud-based applications and understanding various software architecture models. It explores the opportunities provided by the cloud and discusses different types of cloud services, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Serverless solutions. The chapter also covers the use of hybrid solutions and their benefits. The choice between these options depends on the specific project scenario, which will be further discussed in the chapter.

## Different software deployment models
- Cloud solutions can be deployed using different models depending on the type of team and organization. Companies with infrastructure engineers typically opt for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) where they have more control over the infrastructure. On the other hand, companies whose core business is not IT often prefer Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. Developers may choose Platform as a Service (PaaS) or serverless options when they don't need to manage the infrastructure. As a software architect, it is important to optimize cost and work factors throughout the development and maintenance of the solution. It is crucial to understand the system's needs and connect them with peripheral solutions to accelerate delivery and meet customer specifications.

### IaaS and Azure opportunities
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service model where the computing infrastructure, including servers, storage, and firewalls, is provided and managed by a cloud provider. In Azure, there are various IaaS services available, such as virtual machines, network components, and storage options. As a software architect, it is important to understand these services and choose the ones that best fit the project requirements. Azure allows you to easily create and configure virtual machines, offering a wide range of hardware options with high computing power and scalability. The cloud's agility and quick time-to-market make it an excellent choice for temporary workloads or new business ideas that require significant computing resources. Cloud computing provides capabilities that may not be readily available in on-premises data centers, allowing for efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.

#### Security responsibility in IaaS
- When using an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform, it's important to understand that the responsibility for security is shared between the cloud provider and the user. Contrary to popular belief, the cloud provider does not handle all aspects of security. The user is still responsible for securing the operating system and the application layers. This means that you need to implement security measures and best practices to protect your system, which can increase the overall cost.

- IaaS is a suitable choice if you want to migrate an existing on-premises infrastructure to the cloud while maintaining scalability. Azure offers tools and services that facilitate this transition. However, if you're starting a new application development project, it's advisable to consider other options available in Azure beyond IaaS.
