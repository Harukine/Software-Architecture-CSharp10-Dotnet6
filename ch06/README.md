# Azure Kubernetes Service
- This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of Kubernetes, the container orchestrator, with a focus on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The chapter starts by explaining the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes and then delves into interacting with a Kubernetes cluster and deploying applications on Azure Kubernetes. The concepts are reinforced with practical examples. It is recommended to have prior knowledge of microservice architecture from Chapter 5 before reading this chapter, as the concepts from previous chapters will be utilized. The chapter covers Kubernetes basics, interacting with Azure Kubernetes clusters, and advanced Kubernetes concepts. By the end of the chapter, readers will have the knowledge to implement and deploy a comprehensive solution using Azure Kubernetes Service.

## Kubernetes basics
- Kubernetes is an open-source orchestrator widely used for cluster orchestration. It consists of a cluster of virtual machines called nodes, running the Kubernetes orchestrator. The basic unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which is a group of containerized applications. Pods running on the same node can easily communicate through localhost ports, while communication between different pods is more complex due to their ephemeral nature and the possibility of replication. Master nodes manage the cluster and communicate with administrators through an API server. The scheduler allocates pods to nodes based on constraints, and the controller manager monitors the cluster's state and works towards the desired state. Services handle communication between pods, providing constant virtual addresses to sets of pod replicas. Kubernetes entities can be labeled and selected using selectors. Stateless pods are organized in ReplicaSets, while stateful pod replicas are organized in StatefulSets, which use sharding to split traffic among the pods. Kubernetes does not provide predefined storage facilities, so long-term storage is typically provided through cloud databases or other cloud storage options. YAML files can be used to define Kubernetes entities, and once deployed, the entities specified in the file are created in the cluster.
