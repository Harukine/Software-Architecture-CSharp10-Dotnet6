# 1 Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture

## What is software architecture?
A software architect's main goal is to ensure a well-implemented software application through good design. The software development life cycle encompasses activities like defining customer requirements, designing a solution, implementing it, validating with the customer, and delivering in a working environment. Regardless of the development model used, performing these tasks is crucial for delivering acceptable software. Designing great solutions involves meeting user requirements, delivering on time and within budget, ensuring good quality, and enabling future evolution. Sustainable software relies on modern tools and environments to meet user needs effectively.
## Software development process models
Dictate how software is produced and delivered by teams. Over time, various models have been proposed for software development. It's important to review both traditional and agile models, which are widely used today.
### Models
1. Waterfall
- The waterfall model follows a sequential approach, consisting of requirements gathering, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. However, the use of waterfall models can lead to issues such as delayed delivery and user dissatisfaction. Additionally, waiting until after development to start testing can be stressful.
2. Incremental
- Incremental development is an alternative approach to the waterfall model that addresses its main drawback: the user can only test the solution at the end of the project. In incremental development, users have early interactions with the solution to provide valuable feedback throughout the software development process. The incremental model involves running a set of practices for each increment, including communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment.
3. Agile
- Agile models emphasize fast delivery of software and increased interaction with customers. However, it's important to note that agile processes require discipline and flexibility. The Agile Manifesto's 12 principles highlight the importance of delivering valuable software, embracing changing requirements, using short timescales, forming collaborative teams, prioritizing face-to-face communication, and continuously improving. 
4. Lean
- Lean software development, inspired by Toyota's manufacturing method, embraces seven principles: eliminating waste, building quality from the start, creating knowledge, deferring commitments, delivering quickly, respecting the team, and optimizing the value cycle. Following these principles improves feature quality, reduces wasted effort, and focuses on delivering software that matters to the customer.
5. Extreme Programming
- Extreme Programming (XP) emerged as a social change in programming, emphasizing simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage. It promotes face-to-face communication, early feedback, team expertise, and truthfulness about progress. XP introduces rules for planning, managing, designing, coding, and testing. Some widely adopted practices include user stories, iterative development, sustainable velocity, simplicity, refactoring, involving the customer, continuous integration, test-driven development, coding standards, pair programming, and acceptance tests. Many of these practices are now integral to methodologies like DevOps and Scrum.
6. Scrum
- Scrum is an agile model used for managing software development projects. It is based on Lean principles and is widely adopted in the industry. The Scrum framework involves having a flexible backlog of user requirements, which are discussed and addressed in iterative cycles called Sprints. The Scrum Team, consisting of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, collaborates to determine the Sprint goal and deliver the required features. Scrum is often combined with Kanban, a visual system for tracking progress. It is important to note that Scrum focuses on project management and does not specify software implementation details. Combining Scrum with a software development process model like DevOps can be beneficial.
## Gathering the right information to design high-quality software
- Two crucial tasks in software development are defining the development process and gathering software requirements. These tasks play a vital role in ensuring project success. Defining a suitable process, which may occur during project planning, sets the foundation for efficient development. Gathering requirements, a continuous and challenging process, helps shape the software architecture by addressing user needs. These tasks are considered essential for achieving success in software development projects, and as a software architect, your role is to facilitate them to minimize potential issues and guide your team effectively.
### Understanding the requirements gathering process
- Requirements can be represented in various ways, but the traditional approach involves writing a detailed specification before analysis. However, agile methods propose using user stories at the start of development cycles. Regardless of the approach chosen, requirements engineering involves specific steps to gather requirements. It is important to ensure the feasibility of the solution during this process, which may include a separate feasibility analysis or be integrated into project planning. The requirements engineering process provides valuable information that informs software architecture decisions.
### Detecting exact user needs
- Common techniques of elicitating user requirements.
1. The power of imagination
2. Questionnaires
3. Interviews
4. Observation
### Analyzing requirements
- Once you have user needs, analyzing the requirement techniques.
1. Prototyping: Prototypes are fantastic to clarify and materialize the system requirements. (Pencil Project, Figma)
2. Use cases: The Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case model is an option if you need
detailed documentation. (LucidCharts)
### Writing the specifications
- After completing the analysis phase, it is crucial to document the findings in a requirements specification. This document serves as a technical contract between the user and the development team. To ensure clarity and understanding, the specification should follow certain guidelines: stakeholders of all technical backgrounds should comprehend it, classification of each requirement is necessary, and the use of simple future tense is recommended. Ambiguity and controversy must be avoided. Additional information, such as an introductory chapter, glossary, user description, and functional/non-functional requirements, can provide context for the project. When using user stories, it is beneficial to write short sentences that outline each user's needs, goals, and reasons for the requested features. These stories aid in prioritization and can guide the creation of automated acceptance tests.
### Understanding the principles of scalability, robustness, security, and performance.
- As a software architect, detecting requirements goes beyond functional aspects and includes understanding non-functional requirements. Scalability, robustness, security, and performance are key principles to consider during the requirements gathering process. Scalability ensures the application can handle increasing resource demands. Robustness guarantees a stable and always-on solution, crucial for critical systems that require continuous operation. Security must be designed into the solution to address global concerns and legal requirements. Performance needs to be discussed with the user to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize system efficiency. These concepts represent requirements for modern solutions, and meeting them distinguishes good software from exceptional software.
### Reviewing the specifications
- After writing the specification, it is important to seek confirmation from stakeholders regarding their agreement. This can be done through a review meeting or online collaboration tools. During this stage, prototypes, documents, and gathered information are presented. Once everyone agrees with the specification, you can proceed to study the optimal implementation approach for that particular part of the project. It's worth noting that this process can be applied to either the entire software or just a specific component.
## Using design techniques as a helpful tool
- Defining a solution and choosing the appropriate technology can be challenging for software architects. It is not uncommon for customers to present a solution that may have architectural and functional flaws, leading to future problems. In cases where the customer is unsure of the best solution, design techniques like Design Thinking and Design Sprint can be valuable. These techniques help uncover genuine requirements and provide software architects with the opportunity to guide their team in using the right tools for a successful project.
### Design Thinking
- Design Thinking is a user-centered process that aims to gather data directly from users to solve problems effectively. By empathizing with users and understanding their concerns, the team can develop software that prioritizes user experience. The process involves steps such as empathizing, defining user needs, ideating potential solutions, prototyping them, and testing them with users. Design Thinking helps accelerate the decision-making process and consider the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Prototyping allows stakeholders to visualize the final product and encourages the team to deliver the best solution.
### Design Sprint
- Design Sprint is a five-day process developed by Google to address critical business questions through design. It allows for quick testing and learning of ideas when building and launching a solution to the market. The process involves a week-long effort by experts in a designated war room. Each day has a specific focus, including identifying the sprint target and mapping the challenge, sketching solutions, deciding on the best solutions and creating a storyboard, prototyping the chosen idea, and finally, presenting the prototype to customers and gathering feedback. Both Design Thinking and Design Sprint emphasize the importance of prototyping to accelerate customer feedback and make ideas more tangible for end users.
## Common cases where the requirements gathering process impacts system results
1. Performance 
- Performance is a significant challenge for software architects due to limited computational resources and the high cost of computation, particularly in systems with a large number of simultaneous users. While performance problems cannot be solved through requirements alone, writing clear and specific requirements regarding desired performance is crucial. By setting performance targets in requirements, such as web pages responding within a specified time frame even with concurrent user access, the entire team can understand the goals. Additionally, creating a favorable development and deployment environment is important, with ASP.NET Core being a recommended option for delivering fast web applications. To ensure performance, software architects should employ relevant techniques and conduct specific tests, leveraging ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure's Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions.
- Backend caching is a valuable technique for optimizing performance by avoiding repetitive and time-consuming queries. When certain data, such as car models, remains static despite database updates, caching that information can greatly improve application efficiency. Backend caching is typically stored and shared across the entire application, often utilizing in-memory caching. For scalable solutions, a distributed cache can be configured using the Azure platform. ASP.NET supports both in-memory and distributed caching options, allowing developers to choose the most suitable approach. In addition, caching can also occur in the frontend, involving proxies, CDNs, and other components along the server's path.
- Asynchronous programming in ASP.NET allows for the efficient handling of simultaneous user access. By utilizing the "async" and "await" keywords, developers can design their applications to run asynchronously without blocking the calling thread. This pattern improves application performance and responsiveness by preventing performance bottlenecks. By leveraging asynchronous programming, ASP.NET applications can effectively handle multiple user requests without sacrificing efficiency.
- Understanding how the Garbage Collector (GC) works is crucial for optimizing performance in your application. Certain types of objects, particularly those related to I/O operations, need to be properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks and maintain performance. Using the "using" statement is the correct approach for working with I/O objects, ensuring proper disposal and resource management. It is also recommended to follow this practice for all disposable objects. Additionally, avoiding the allocation of large objects is important to prevent excessive GC processing time, which can negatively impact application performance. By adhering to these guidelines, you can optimize memory usage and prevent performance issues caused by improper object allocation.
- Database access is a common source of performance issues in software applications. The problem often stems from inadequate attention given to query and expression writing when retrieving data from the database. It is crucial to understand how to choose the right approach and retrieve the necessary data efficiently. Filtering columns and rows is particularly important for optimizing performance. The good news is that best practices such as caching, asynchronous programming, and proper object allocation can greatly improve database performance. By employing these techniques, developers can create high-performing software that interacts effectively with databases.
2. Implementation
- In the case where the user's needs are not properly implemented, it can be challenging for developers to deliver exactly what the user requires, especially in specific areas of expertise. While developers may be skilled in software development, understanding the unique needs of different industries can be more difficult. Gathering software requirements and writing them can help in organizing the system's architecture and minimizing the risk of implementing something different from the user's actual needs. Prototyping the interface, designing the data flow, and having frequent meetings with users can aid in achieving a better understanding and alignment with incremental deliveries. As a software architect, you hold the responsibility for defining how the software will be implemented, even if you are not the one programming it. Techniques such as reviewing requirements with developers, code inspection, and holding meetings to address impediments can help ensure the correct implementation. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to ensure that the software aligns with the user's needs, and using every available tool is essential in achieving this goal.
3. Usability
- Ensuring the usability of a software system is crucial for its success. As a software architect, it is essential to deliver software with good usability. Understanding the user and their needs is a key factor in achieving usability. Design Thinking can be a valuable tool in this regard. By understanding the target users, you can make informed decisions about the platform and devices on which the software will run. It is important to design software that can run on various platforms and devices to meet the diverse needs of users. Fortunately, with .NET 6, there are excellent cross-platform options available, enabling the development of applications for Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and more. An open-minded approach is necessary for software architects to design software that precisely meets the needs of their users across different platforms and devices.
