# Interacting with Data in C# - Entity Framework Core
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and its importance in building data layers for enterprise applications. We discuss the basics of ORM and its role in mapping data between the storage subsystem and objects. We then dive into Entity Framework Core, a popular ORM tool included in .NET 6. We cover the configuration of Entity Framework Core and discuss how to perform database migrations to manage schema changes. Additionally, we explore compiled models and how they can improve performance.
- We also delves into querying and updating data using Entity Framework Core, providing examples and best practices. We discuss deploying the data layer and highlight advanced features of Entity Framework Core, such as global filters. You will have a solid understanding of ORM, Entity Framework Core, and how to effectively work with data in C# applications.
