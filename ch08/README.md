# How to Choose Your Data Storage in the Cloud
- This chapter provides guidance on selecting appropriate data storage solutions in the cloud, focusing primarily on Azure's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. Custom architectures involving virtual machines are discussed briefly, but the emphasis is on exploring scalable options such as plain disk space, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and in-memory data stores like Redis.
- Choosing the right storage type is determined by the application's functional needs, performance requirements, and scaling considerations. While scaling out processing resources can lead to linear performance improvements, scaling out storage resources doesn't necessarily guarantee the same level of improvement, especially for write operations. Factors like data distribution, geographical considerations, and the limitations of certain storage engines also play a pivotal role in making informed choices for data storage, especially when opting for SaaS solutions.

## Understanding the different repositories for different purposes
- This section provides an overview of different data storage techniques and their functionalities. The focus is on understanding the purposes they serve and the functional requirements they can fulfill. Performance and scalability aspects will be discussed in the next section, particularly in the context of comparing relational and NoSQL databases. Azure's database offerings can be accessed through the search bar on the Azure portal. The subsequent subsections delve into various types of databases applicable to C# projects.
