# How to Choose Your Data Storage in the Cloud
- This chapter provides guidance on selecting appropriate data storage solutions in the cloud, focusing primarily on Azure's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. Custom architectures involving virtual machines are discussed briefly, but the emphasis is on exploring scalable options such as plain disk space, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and in-memory data stores like Redis.
- Choosing the right storage type is determined by the application's functional needs, performance requirements, and scaling considerations. While scaling out processing resources can lead to linear performance improvements, scaling out storage resources doesn't necessarily guarantee the same level of improvement, especially for write operations. Factors like data distribution, geographical considerations, and the limitations of certain storage engines also play a pivotal role in making informed choices for data storage, especially when opting for SaaS solutions.
